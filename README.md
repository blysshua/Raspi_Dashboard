# Raspi_Dashboard

I finally got my hands on a raspberry pi with the goal to self host and to mark the start of my home labbing journey.

I created a dashboard in bash to display current active/ inactive services, connected devices, different sessions, and btop to monitor processes and system health

Tmux is used to split the screens as I am using a headless pi OS.

I do plan on adding more services and editing the visuals of the dashboard in the future
