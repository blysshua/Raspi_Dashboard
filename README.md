# Raspi_Dashboard

I finally got my hands on a raspberry pi with the goal to self host and to mark the start of my home labbing journey.

I created a dashboard in bash to display current active/ inactive services, connected devices, different sessions, and btop to monitor processes and system health. In the future, I plan on attaching an E-ink screen for this dashboard to be displayed on so it won't require me to always check via SSH.

Tmux is used to split the screens as I am using a headless pi OS.

I do plan on adding more services and editing the visuals of the dashboard in the future
